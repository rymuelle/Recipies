Here's a cleaned-up version of your README with corrected spelling, grammar, formatting, and minor clarity improvements. I also converted the ingredients into a markdown table as requested:

## Intro

Essentially, only two things are needed for dough to bake into bread:

1. A glutinous network that can hold air
2. Air trapped within that network

If those two things are met, you will bake bread. The most common failure is that the network either contains too little air, resulting in dense bread, or it has sat too long and can no longer hold air. The good news is that there's a fairly large window of time where things will still work well.

This recipe is designed to meet the above criteria in a minimal way. If done well, it will still result in very good bread.

## Ingredients

| Ingredient                    | Amount |
| ----------------------------- | ------ |
| All-purpose or bread flour    | 500 g  |
| Water                         | 325 g  |
| Salt                          | 10 g   |
| Yeast (instant or active dry) | 6 g    |

### Notes:

1. A high-protein (read: gluten) flour is ideal. Recommended: King Arthur Flour (KAF). Bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose, but KAF all-purpose is high enough.
2. A key factor in bread is hydration percentage. This bread is at 65% hydration (325 g water / 500 g flour). You could make this bread anywhere from 55% to 85% hydration and get very different, but good, results. 70% is a good default, but 65% is a bit easier to work with.
3. Salt is salt. It doesn’t really matter what kind you use, but some people dislike the taste of iodized salt.
4. Any yeast works. I recommend buying a jar of instant or active dry.
5. Using a kitchen scale is highly recommended, but you can convert to volume measurements if needed.

You’ll also want:

* A bowl
* A cloth
* A baking sheet
* Parchment paper
* A kitchen scale

## Instructions

### Mixing

Basically, just mix the ingredients.

Note: Try wetting your hands and pulling the dough ball apart—it will fall apart easily. Also note how dense the dough is before air is incorporated.

1. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix for 5 seconds with a metal spoon.
2. Form a little well in the middle of the flour and pour in the water.
3. Mix the flour and water with the spoon until no dry patches remain. A shaggy ball will form.
4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or cutting board to prevent drying.

### Bulk Rise

The goal of this step is to generate the bread’s internal structure through fermentation, which produces both gas and flavor.

#### Stretch and Fold (Repeat 3 Times)

Note how much more elastic the dough becomes after just 15 minutes. Also note how the dough ball tightens when you stretch and fold it.

4. Wait 15 minutes.
5. Remove the cover, wet your hands (literally just run them under the faucet), and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90° between each stretch.

6. Cover the dough again.

#### Continue Bulk Rise

Let the dough rise for 1–2 hours at room temperature. Alternatively, place it in the fridge overnight.

### Proofing

When the dough is smooth, elastic, and has at least doubled in volume, it’s ready to be shaped and proofed for baking. Proofing optimizes the amount of air and surface tension in the dough before baking.

7. Flour the top of the dough and your hands. Turn it out onto a floured surface. It can help to "scrape" the dough out with the edge of your hand.
8. [Shape the dough into a boule (ball)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg). This involves folding the dough and then rolling it to create surface tension. The key idea: the front edge of the dough is slightly stuck to the counter, so when you push the back forward with the edge of your hands, it tightens the top of the loaf.
9. Place the dough ball on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Dust the top with flour and cover with a mostly dry cloth.
10. Set two timers: one for 20 minutes, and another for 45 minutes.
11. After 20 minutes, preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C).
12. After 45 minutes, remove the cloth carefully in case it has stuck to the dough. The dough should be puffier and jigglier than before, but should *not* deflate when poked. Test readiness: poke the edge with a wet finger about half a fingertip deep. The indentation should rebound slightly, but not fully. If it rebounds fully, wait another 15 minutes and try again.
13. [Score the top of the loaf](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA) with a sharp kitchen knife or bread knife.
14. Bake for 35 minutes. I recomend covering the bread with a bit of alumium foil for the first 25, then removing it for the last 10, but this is not needed. You will know the loaf is done when it is golden brown on the outside and sounds hollow when tapped. Alternatively, when the internal temperature is > 190F. 
15. Let the bread rest for 30 minutes. It's still cooking a bit and will be damp on the inside.

It should rise beautifully in the oven and develop a nice golden-brown crust!

There are many ways to improve from here, but these are the basic steps for making good bread.

**P.S.** This dough base also makes a great pizza crust. Just change the proofing step:
Instead of forming one boule, divide the dough into 2 or 3 portions and shape each into a small ball. Let them proof before stretching into disks—and you’ve got pizza dough!
