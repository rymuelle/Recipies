## Intro


This recipe is a minimal version of the most common method for baking bread, but don't think that means the end product isn't high quality. This recipe can produce insanely good baguettes, pizzas, or loaves of bread. 

The method starts with mixing ingredients and then letting them ferment or rise to develop flavor and build up gas in the dough. During the rise, we will employ stretches and folds to both develop the structure of the dough and monitor it's progress.

Then, a loaf is shaped and allowed to "proof" for before baking. So, this recipe features two fermentation periods: a bulk rise and a proof. More complex recipes may feature more stages, but nearly all recipes will feature these two stages, and shaping and proving bread is the first skill bakers must master. 




### A brief explanation on "why" we prove bread:

When manipulating dough (folding, shaping, kneading), the gluten network tightens and resists change. As the  dough rests, it looses it's tension and strength. We want to control the tension in the network at the time of baking, so we shape and then rest the dough for a bit so that it has enough tension to not collapse, but not so much that it resists rising and tears.

In general, I advise paying attention to how the dough feels and behaves in each step. Is it sticky or easy to handle? Does it stretch or deform when pulled? Does it collapse or hold it's volume when poked? These properties will change with time, manipulation, and fermentation.

### Last notes

Don't stress about doing everything perfect. Essentially, only two things are needed for dough to bake into bread:

1. A glutinous network that can hold air
2. Air trapped within that network

If those two things are met, you will bake bread. The most common failure is that the network either contains too little air, resulting in dense bread, or it has sat too long and can no longer hold air. The good news is that there's a fairly large window of time where things will still work well.

...And even if it does collapse (e.g. it is overproofed), you can just reshape it and try again or bake it as a flat bread.

## Ingredients

There are only 4 ingredients required for bread, and most of the bread I bake only has those 4:

| Ingredient                    | Amount | Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| All-purpose or bread flour    | 500 g  | 100%       |
| Water                         | 325 g  | 65%        |
| Salt                          | 10 g   | 2%         |
| Yeast (instant or active dry) | 5 g    | 1%         |

### Notes:

1. A high-protein (read: gluten) flour is ideal. Recommended: King Arthur Flour (KAF). Bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose, but KAF all-purpose is high enough and too high can result in tougher bread.
2. Hydration percentage is the main knob a baker can turn to modify their bread. This bread is at 65% hydration (325 g water / 500 g flour). You could make this bread anywhere from 55% to 85% hydration and get very different, but good, results. 70% is a good default, but 65% is a bit easier to work with. In general, "bakers percentages" are percent of the flour by weight.
3. Salt is salt. It doesn’t really matter what kind you use, but some people dislike the taste of iodized salt.
4. Any yeast works. I recommend buying a jar of instant or active dry. Way cheaper than the packets, and it will last forever in the freezer. Yeast are hardy.
5. Using a kitchen scale is highly recommended, but you can convert to volume measurements if needed.

You’ll also want:

* A bowl
* A cloth
* A baking sheet
* Parchment paper
* A kitchen scale
* A rigid spoon
* Some aluminum foil

## Instructions

### Mixing

Just mix the ingredients until combined. 

Note: Try wetting your hands and pulling the dough ball apart. It will fall apart easily at this stage. Also note how dense and sticky the dough is.

1. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix briefly with a sturdy spoon.
2. Form a little depression in the middle of the flour and pour in the water.
3. Mix the flour and water with the spoon until a shaggy ball with no large dry clumps remain. 
4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent drying.

### Bulk Rise

The goal of this step is to generate the bread’s internal structure and ferment it, producing gas and flavor.

#### Stretch and Fold (Repeat 3 Times)

Note how much more elastic the dough becomes after just 15 minutes. Also note how the dough ball tightens when you stretch and fold it.

4. Wait 15 minutes.
5. Remove the cover, wet your hands (run them under the faucet), and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90° between each stretch.
   [Example Video.](https://youtu.be/QYzxulQY1Gc?t=11) Since we are only making a single 500 g loaf, the dough ball may just lift out of the bowl as you stretch it. That's ok, you can just grab it with both hands to stretch it.
6. Cover the dough again.

#### Continue Bulk Rise

The dough should now be smooth and elastic, and maybe very slightly filled with air. Let the dough rise for 1+ hours at room temperature. Alternatively, place it in the fridge overnight (or up to a few days). The longer and colder you ferment, the more sour flavor will develop. Eventually it will start to become almost sour dough like.

The key in this step is to pay attention to the dough. Check the dough after one hour. If it does not seem noticeably swollen with air, check back in 30 minutes and repeat. Bake to the dough, not to the recipe.

### Proofing

When the dough is smooth, elastic, and has at least doubled in volume, it’s ready to be shaped and proofed for baking. Proofing optimizes the amount of air and surface tension in the dough before baking.

The shaping step takes a bit of practice to get right, feel free to play around with the dough ball to find a technique that works for you. However, if the dough ball becomes stiff from shaping and resists further manipulation, let it rest 10-15 minutes before trying again. The goal is just to get it shaped like a ball with plenty of tension in the loaf. 


7. Lightly flour the top of the dough and your hands. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. It can help to "scrape" the dough out with the edge of your hand to avoid ripping it. 
8. [Shape the dough into a boule (ball)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg). This involves folding the dough and then "scraping/rolling" the ball towards yourself with your pinky fingers to build tension on the surface. If done right, the edge of the ball facing you will stick to the surface, while the edge your hand is scraping will slide. This causes the top of the ball to stretch adding tension and making the ball smooth. It can take a bit to get right. If the ball slides instead of rolls, you can brush off flour the help with sticking.
9. Cradle the dough ball with both hands and place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Dust the top with flour and cover with the damp cloth.
10. Set two timers: one for 20 minutes, and another for 45 minutes.
11. After 20 minutes, preheat your oven to 450F.
12. After 45 minutes, remove the cloth carefully in case it has stuck to the dough. The dough should be puffier and jigglier than before, but should not deflate when poked. To test the readiness: poke the edge with a wet finger about half a fingertip deep. The indentation should hardly rebound, but also not collapse. If it rebounds, wait another 15 minutes and try again.

### Baking
Steaming the bread creates a nice crust. We will emulate that by roughly covering the load with aluminum foil and dampening the surface of the bread. In addition, you can put a disposable pie tin with water in it next to the bread. Even better, bake the loaf in a closed container, such as a dutch oven, but we will keep it simple for now. This delays the setting of the crust, enabling a better over rise and a better crust. Scoring the loaf also helps the rise and allows you to decorate the loaf. 


13. [Score the top of the loaf](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA) with a sharp kitchen knife or bread knife (or, ideally a razor blade/lame). My best tip here is to slice in one smooth motion about 3/4 of an inch deep. 
14. Pour/sprinkle water over the top of the scored loaf such that it is wet but there isn't a lot of water pooled around the edges using a cup or your hands and then cover the top with a bent/bowled piece of aluminum foil to prevent early browning. You may also put a tray of water into the oven to increase the humidity. 
15. Bake for 35-40 minutes. Remove the foil after 25 minutes. You will know the loaf is done when it is browned on the outside and sounds hollow when tapped. Alternatively, when the internal temperature is >190F. Feel free to leave it in longer to brown it more. 
16. Let the bread rest for 30 minutes. It's still cooking a bit and will be damp on the inside.

It should rise beautifully in the oven and develop a nice golden-brown crust! As it cools, you may hear the bread crackle, this is called "singing" and indicates you have a nice, crisp crust. 

Basic troubleshooting:

1. If the bread rips the crust, it needs to proof for longer (underproofed).
2. If the bread collapses, it proofed too long (overproofed).
3. If the bread hardly rises at all and is dense, pale, and gummy, it needed more air in it.
