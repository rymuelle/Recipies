## Intro:

Essentially, only two things are needed for dough to bake into bread:

1. A glutinous network that can hold air
2. Air trapped within that network

If those two things are met, you will bake bread. The general failing for bread is that the network either has too little air in it and thus it becomes dense, or it has sit for too long and no longer has the strength to hold air. The good news is that there is a large amount of time that is acceptable, if not optimal. 

This recipie serves as to meet that set of criteria in a minimal way. If done well, it will still result in very good bread however. 

## Ingreidents

(format into table)
1. All purpose (AP) or bread flour 500 g
2. Water 325g
3. Salt 10g
4. Yeast 6g

Notes:
1. A high protein (read: gluten) flour is optimal. Reccomend: King Arthur Flour (KAF). Bread flour has higher protein content than all purpose, but KAF AP is the high enough as is. 
2. A key factor of bread is hydration percentage. This bread is 325/500=65% hydration. You could make this bread between 55% and 85% hydration and acheive very different final products that are all good. A good default is 70% hydration, but 65% is a bit easier to work with. 
3. Salt is salt. It doesn't matter what kind you use, but some people don't like the taste iodized salt adds. 
4. Any yeast works, I recomend buying a jar of instant or active dry. 
5. I generally recommend using a kitchen scale for this, but you can convert to volume measurements. 


You also will want a bowl, a cloth, a baking sheet, parchment paper, and a kitchen scale. 

## Instructions

### Mixing
Basically, the instructions are just to mix the ingriedients. 
Note: try wetting your hands and pulling the dough ball apart. It will fall apart easily. Also note how dense the dough is when it has no air in it. 

1. Combine dry ingriedients in a bowl and mix for 5 seconds with a metal spoon. 
2. Form a little hole in the middle of the flour and poor the water in.
3. Mix the flour and water with the spoon till no dry patches remain to form a shaggy ball.
4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth or a cutting board to prevent drying. 

### Bulk Rise
The purpose of this step is to generate the structure of the bread and ferment it producing gas and flavor. 

#### Stretch and Folf (repeat 3 times)
Note how much more elastic the dough becomes just waiting 15 minutes. Also note how the dough ball tenses up as you stretch and fold it. 
4. Wait 15 minutes.
5. Remove covering, wet hands (litterally just put them under a faucet), and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90 degrees between stretches. \href{https://youtu.be/QYzxulQY1Gc?t=11}{Example Video}
6. Cover dough again. 

#### Bulk Rise
Now, simply let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours. You could also put it in the fridge overnight. 


### Proofing
When the doughball is smooth, elastic, and has expanded by at least 2x the volume due to air accumulation, it can be shaped and "proofed" for baking. The purpose of proofing is just to optimize the amount of air and tension in the dough ball for baking. 
7. Flour the top of the dough ball (and your hands) and turn it out onto a floured surface. It can help to "scrape" the dough ball out with the edge of your hand. 
8. \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg}{Shape the dough ball into a "boule" (ball).} The procedure is basically folding the ball and then rolling it to create additional tension. The rolling part can take a bit of getting used to, but it's ok if it's not perfect. The idea of rolling the ball is that the edge of the dough facing away from your hands (the front) is very slightly stuck to the counter, so when you push on the base of the dough with the edge of your hands, the back of the loaf is moved towards the stuck front of the loaf and the top of the loaf is tensioned. 
9. Put dough ball on a baking sheet with parchment paper, dust the top with flour, and cover it with a mostly dry cloth.
10. Put a timer on for 20 minutes and 45 minutes. 
11. After 20 minutes, preheat the oven at 450F.
12. After 45 minutes, remove the cloth carefully in case it stuck to the dough ball. The dough ball should be puffier and jigglier than before, but it should not deflate when poked. Poke the doughball on the edge around half a finger digit in depth with a wet finger. The hole should rebound slightly, but not fully. If it rebounds fully, check back in 15 minutes and try again.
13. \href{https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA}{Score the loaf with a sharp kitchen knife or breadknife.}
14. Put in the oven for 30 minutes. 


It should rise beautifully in the over and bake to a nice golden brown!

There are a lot of improvements that can be made, but these are the baisic steps that make for a good bread. 

p.s. This doughbase makes a great pizza crust. The only step you change is the proofing stage. Instead, cut the dough into 2 or 3 and shape it into small balls. Then let it proof before stretching it into disks and you have pizza dough!
