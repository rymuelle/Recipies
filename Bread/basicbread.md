## Intro
This recipe is a minimal version of the most common method for baking bread, but don't think that means the end product isn't high quality. This recipe can produce insanely good baguettes, pizzas, or "boules". There are 4 steps: mixing, bulk rise, proofing and baking. 

In general, I advise paying attention to how the dough feels and behaves in each step. Is it sticky or easy to handle? Does it stretch or deform when pulled? Does it collapse or hold it's volume when poked? These properties will change with time and fermentation.

Don't stress about doing everything perfect. Essentially, only two things are needed for dough to bake into bread:

1. A glutinous network that can hold air
2. Air trapped within that network

If those two things are met, you will bake bread. The most common failure is that the network either contains too little air, resulting in dense bread, or it has sat too long and can no longer hold air. The good news is that there's a fairly large window of time where things will still work well.

...And even if it does collapse (e.g. it is overproofed), you can just reshape it and try again or bake it as a flat bread.

## Ingredients

There are only 4 ingredients required for bread, and most of the bread I bake only has those 4:

| Ingredient                    | Amount | Percentage |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| All-purpose or bread flour    | 500 g  | 100%       |
| Water                         | 325 g  | 65%        |
| Salt                          | 10 g   | 2%         |
| Yeast (instant or active dry) | 5 g    | 1%         |

### Notes:

1. A high-protein (read: gluten) flour is ideal. Recommended: King Arthur Flour (KAF). Bread flour has a higher protein content than all-purpose, but KAF all-purpose is high enough and too high can result in tougher bread.
2. Hydration percentage is the main knob a baker can turn to modify their bread. This bread is at 65% hydration (325 g water / 500 g flour). You could make this bread anywhere from 55% to 85% hydration and get very different, but good, results. 70% is a good default, but 65% is a bit easier to work with. In general, "bakers percentages" are percent of the flour by weight.
3. Salt is salt. It doesn’t really matter what kind you use, but some people dislike the taste of iodized salt.
4. Any yeast works. I recommend buying a jar of instant or active dry. Way cheaper than the packets, and it will last forever in the freezer. Yeast are hardy.
5. Using a kitchen scale is highly recommended, but you can convert to volume measurements if needed.

You’ll also want:

* A bowl
* A cloth
* A baking sheet
* Parchment paper
* A kitchen scale

## Instructions

### Mixing

Basically, just mix the ingredients.

Note: Try wetting your hands and pulling the dough ball apart. It will fall apart easily at this stage. Also note how dense and sticky the dough is.

1. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl and mix briefly with a sturdy spoon.
2. Form a little depression in the middle of the flour and pour in the water.
3. Mix the flour and water with the spoon untila shaggy ball with no large dry clumps remain. 
4. Cover the bowl with a damp cloth to prevent drying.

### Bulk Rise

The goal of this step is to generate the bread’s internal structure and ferment it, producing gas and flavor.

#### Stretch and Fold (Repeat 3 Times)

Note how much more elastic the dough becomes after just 15 minutes. Also note how the dough ball tightens when you stretch and fold it.

4. Wait 15 minutes.
5. Remove the cover, wet your hands (run them under the faucet), and stretch and fold the dough 4 times, rotating 90° between each stretch.

6. Cover the dough again.

#### Continue Bulk Rise

Let the dough rise for 1–2 hours at room temperature. Alternatively, place it in the fridge overnight (or up to a few days). The longer and colder you ferment, the more sour flavor will develop. Eventually it will start to become almost sour dough like.

### Proofing

When the dough is smooth, elastic, and has at least doubled in volume, it’s ready to be shaped and proofed for baking. Proofing optimizes the amount of air and surface tension in the dough before baking.

The shaping step takes a bit of practice to get right, feel free to play around with the dough ball to find a technique that works for you. However, if the dough ball becomes stiff from shaping, let it rest, and note that in general you don't want to preserve most of the air in the dough when shaping. 

7. Flour the top of the dough and your hands. Turn it out onto a floured surface. It can help to "scrape" the dough out with the edge of your hand.
8. [Shape the dough into a boule (ball)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg). This involves folding the dough and then "rolling" it to create surface tension. The key idea: the dough will be slightly stuck to the counter, so when you push the back edge of the contact patch forward with the edge of your hands, it tightens the top of the loaf. 
9. Place the dough ball on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Dust the top with flour and cover with a mostly dry cloth.
10. Set two timers: one for 20 minutes, and another for 45 minutes.
11. After 20 minutes, preheat your oven to 475°F.
12. After 45 minutes, remove the cloth carefully in case it has stuck to the dough. The dough should be puffier and jigglier than before, but should not deflate when poked. To test the readiness: poke the edge with a wet finger about half a fingertip deep. The indentation should hardly rebound, but also not collapse. If it rebounds, wait another 15 minutes and try again.

### Baking
Steaming the bread creates a nice crust. We will emulate that by roughly covering the load with alumium foil. In addition, you can put a dissposable pie tin with water in it next to the bread. This allowes for the outside of the bread to stay moist as it bakes, so that the bread can rise before a crust forms, and the starches will nicely brown. 
13. [Score the top of the loaf](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sysFPnbt9zA) with a sharp kitchen knife or bread knife (or, ideally a razor blade/lame). My best tip here is to slice in one smooth motion about 3/4 of an inch deep. 
14. Bake for 35 minutes. I recomend covering the bread with a bit of alumium foil for the first 25 to imitate steaming the bread, then removing it for the last 10 to develop a better crush, but this is not needed. You will know the loaf is done when it is golden brown on the outside and sounds hollow when tapped. Alternatively, when the internal temperature is >190F. 
15. Let the bread rest for 30 minutes. It's still cooking a bit and will be damp on the inside.

It should rise beautifully in the oven and develop a nice golden-brown crust!

Basic troubleshooting:

1. If the bread rips the crust, it needs to proof for longer (underproofed).
2. If the bread collapses, it proofed too long (overproofed).
3. If the bread hardly rises at all and is dense, pale, and gummy, it needed way more air in it. 

There are many ways to improve from here, but these are the basic steps for making good bread.

**P.S.** This dough base also makes a great pizza crust. Just change the proofing step:
Instead of forming one boule, divide the dough into 2 or 3 portions and shape each into a small ball. Let them proof before stretching into disks—and you’ve got pizza dough!
